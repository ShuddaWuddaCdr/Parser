# Parser
Repo for the equation parser for Lambda

I haven't had alot of time, but I found a couple sites that have simple/useful parsers made up for breaking up equations. I threw one together and tested it out real quick, so I figured I would make the repo for the parser so you guys can look at it and what not. It seems like with this lexer we can pretty easily break all of the stuff up into a list with ids.

See: parser.rkt
